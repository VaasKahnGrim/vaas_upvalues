# vaas_upvalues
This module is a WIP attempt to readd the debug.setupvalue debug.upvalueid and debug.upvaluejoin functions into gLua.

No I do not care if there was a security issue with it or not, I simply want to be able to use these functions again
and I'm not dealing with facepunch's arbitrary sense of security. (Willox is a nice guy tho imo, without him I'd still be having this thing unable to compile)

If you get backdoored or some shit and somebody uses this module, thats on you not me. Secure your server, stop using workshop.
